# learning_ros2
example code for migration from ROS1 to ROS2
This repo is still being populated, with the intent of emulating the ROS1 examples in:
https://github.com/wsnewman/learning_ros_kinetic

A written description, following the original ROS1 text "A Systematic Approach 
to Learning Robot Programming with ROS", has been initiated in the file:
"learning_ros2".  This is still far from complete and lacks any formatting, but
is hopefully nonetheless useful already.
